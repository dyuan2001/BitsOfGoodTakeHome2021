# Introduction
Hi! I'm Daniel Yuan and this is my submission for the take home for BoG.

I had a ton of fun working on it even though I've never worked with React. I also gained a lot of respect for React developers lol.

It's very buggy although the features are all there. I hope you like it anyways.
